# 1BRC_Workshop
Code for a workshop on covering performance engineering techniques behind [1BRC](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc).

Each version is kept in a separate file to make it easier to compare between versions.

The first version is in the file `CalculateAverage_PEWorkshop1.java`, the next one is in `CalculateAverage_PEWorkshop2.java` and so on.

For each version, there is a corresponding flamegraph as well. For instance, `PEWorkshop1.html` contains flamegraph for the first version.

## Spreadhsheet with Details of each version
This [spreadhseet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WvbVSl01TGdv0fLD_og8D872T6JoaFb8lD_UOm1XaCg/edit?usp=sharing) contains the changes of each version of code, with timing information and flamegraph links.

## Running the Code

If you wish to run these within the [1BRC repo](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc), you have to clonse the 1BRC repo, and copy the Java class there. Follow the instructions of 1BRC repo to build and run it.
